Before we discuss the details of the Verilog language, we must first understand basic hierarchical modeling concepts in digital design. The designer must use a "good" design methodology to do efficient Verilog HDL- based design.

There are two basic types of digital design methodologies: a top-down design methodology and a bottom-up design methodology. 

In a top-down design methodology, we define the top-level block and identify the sub-blocks necessary to build the top-level block.

In a bottom-up design methodology, we first identify the building blocks that are available to us. We build bigger cells, using these building blocks. These cells are then used for higher-level blocks until we build the top-level block in the design.
