SystemVerilog is a significant new enhancement to Verilog and includes major exten- sions into abstract design, testbench, 
formal, and C-based APls. SystemVerilog also defines new layers in the Verilog simulation strata. These extensions provide 
signifi- cant new capabilities to the designer, verification engineer and architect, allowing better teamwork and co-
ordination between different project members. As was the case with the original Verilog, teams who adopt SystemVerilog based 
tools will be more productive and produce better quality designs in shorter periods .


A strong guiding requirement for SystemVerilog is that it should be a true superset of Verilog, and as new tools become available, I believe all Verilog users, and many users of other HDLs, will naturally adopt it.

If you are a designer or architect building digital systems, or a verification engineer searching for bugs in these designs, then SystemVerilog will provide you with signif- icant benefits, and this book is a great place to start to learn SystemVerilog and the future ofHardware Design and Verification Languages. :)

SystemVerilog is a standard set of extensions to the IEEE Std. 1364-2001 Verilog Standard (commonly referred to as "Verllog  2001" .
